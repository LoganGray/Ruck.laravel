# Ruck: Where GTD meets Scrum

Ruck is a home-made task-cum-project manager, incorporating all the stuff I want and none of the stuff I don't. I'm making it for me and no-one else.

This iteration is built on PHP 5.3 using the [Laravel framework](http://laravel.com/).

It appears to be using Laravel verson 3.2.12 per the \laravel\documentation\changes.md file
